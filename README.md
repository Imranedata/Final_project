Project Purpose:
Our goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict house selling prices based on various features. Additionally, we aim to explore the characteristics of houses that contribute to higher property values, specifically those priced at $650,000 and above. This project will involve data exploration, model building, and visualization using business intelligence tools.

Findings:

The dataset comprises 22,000 properties sold between May 2014 to May 2015.
Key features include ID, date of sale, price, waterfront view, condition, grade, square footage (above and living area), and lot size.
Data exploration reveals a mix of numerical and categorical variables.
Initial exploration indicates potential correlations between certain features and house prices.
Next Steps:

Data Exploration:

Utilize descriptive statistics, handle missing values, and visualize data distributions.
Investigate correlations between features and target variable (house prices).

Data Preprocessing:

Scale numerical variables and encode categorical variables.
Handle outliers and normalize data if necessary.

Model Building:

Implement linear regression, KNN, and decision trees for regression and such.
Compare model performances using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, Kappa).

By following these steps, we aim to develop a robust predictive model while gaining valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices, particularly those exceeding $650,000.
